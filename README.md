## Overview

### The challenge

This challenge will test your ability to create dropdown navigation menus, a common pattern on larger sites. It will also provide some nice basic layout challenges.

Your users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Responsive design
- Dropdown navigation menu
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Lazy loading for images
- Accessible and semantic HTML

### What I Learned

Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of:

- **Responsive Design**: Implementing media queries to ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes.
- **CSS Flexbox**: Using flexbox for layout and alignment.
- **JavaScript Event Handling**: Managing click events and toggling classes to show/hide elements.
- **Performance Optimization**: Using lazy loading for images to improve page load times.

### Continued Development

Future improvements and features I plan to add include:

- **Accessibility Enhancements**: Adding ARIA attributes to improve accessibility for screen readers.
- **Additional Animations**: Implementing more animations for a smoother user experience.
- **Code Refactoring**: Continuously reviewing and refactoring the code to improve readability and maintainability.
- **Testing**: Adding unit tests to ensure the functionality works as expected.
